## Hi there 👋

<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Joel, I am a Product and Tech Guy</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Engineer • Head of Product</strong>
</p>

<p align="left">
  I have been engineering mobile apps for almost a decade - I transitioned to Product Management, in the B2B landscape (experimented global B2C product as well) when I realised to what extent organizations were too much focused on building feature factories rather than focusing on product discovery and identifying real business opportunities. I wanted to fix this problem ! 
</p>
<p align="left">
  I am now focused on building human and customer centric products and teams, while building and consolidating my ai engineering capabilities. I work in Trust the Trust and Safety space - Hit me up if you want to know what we do in my current company.

  In my spare time I vibe code a personal project called BlogOS. BlogOS enables me to manage all articles that I want to write on my blog, as well as experimenting with AI Agents, and Agent Memory so as to support a personal knowledge management sysetm ! I then reuse these tech modules to help me drive a personal research project on the history of french revolution in the Indian Ocean. And I usually have the best time of my life doing these things ! :-D
