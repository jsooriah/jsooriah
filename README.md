## Hi there 👋

<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Joel, I am a Product and Tech Guy</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Engineer • Head of Product</strong>
</p>

<p align="left">
  I have been engineering mobile apps for almost a decade - I have stopped coding to transition to Product Management when I realised to what extent organizations were too much focused on building feature factories rather than focusing on product discovery and identifying real business opportunities. I wanted to fix this problem ! 
</p>
<p align="left">
  I am now focused on building products and teams, with a focus on human and customer centric approaches.
</p>
<p align="left">
  I also have a lot of interest in agent memory - In my spare time I vibe code a project called BlogOS. BlogOS enables me to manage all articles that I want to write on myh blog - I vide coded an AI Assistant that helps me in this endeavour !:)
