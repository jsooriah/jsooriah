## Hi there 👋

<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Joel, I am a Product and Tech Guy</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Engineer • Head of Product</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  I have been engineering mobile apps for almost a decade - I have stopped coding to transition to Product Management because I have realised to what extent organizations were too much focused on building feature factories rather than focusing on product discovery and identifying real business opportunities - I have also seen the and experienced the not so good impact this could have on teams. 
  I am now focused on building products and teams, the human and customer centric way, and in the meantime, I have resumed coding as a hobby, mainly because of productivity gains offered by ai tools, and also because it enables me to be creative on multiple aspects.
